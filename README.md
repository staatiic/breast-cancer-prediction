# Breast Cancer Prediction Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on breast cancer prediction using machine learning techniques. The main analysis and development work is contained in the `ong.ipynb` Jupyter notebook.

## Key Components

### ONG Notebook (`ong.ipynb`)
The main notebook contains a comprehensive analysis using the following libraries and techniques:

#### Libraries Used
- NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for machine learning models:
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

#### Analysis Components
- Data loading and preprocessing using the breast cancer dataset
- Feature engineering and selection
- Model development and training
- Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Model evaluation using:
  - Confusion matrices
  - Classification reports
  - Feature importance analysis
- Visualization of results and findings

## Getting Started
1. Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
3. Open `ong.ipynb` to view the analysis and results

## Project Structure
- `ong.ipynb`: Main analysis notebook containing the complete machine learning pipeline
- Additional files and resources (if any)

## Note
The ONG notebook contains comprehensive analysis and should be viewed in Jupyter Notebook for the best experience, as it includes interactive visualizations and code execution capabilities.
